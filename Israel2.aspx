Israel, officially the State of Israel, is a country in Western Asia. It is situated on the southeastern shore of the 
Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea, and shares borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, 
Jordan to the east, and Egypt to the southwest; it is also bordered by the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip to the east and west, respectively. Tel Aviv is the economic and technological center of the country, while its seat of 
government is in its proclaimed capital of Jerusalem, although Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem is unrecognized.

Inhabited since the Middle Bronze Age by Canaanite tribes, the land held by present-day Israel was once the setting for much of
Biblical history, beginning with the 9th-century Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah,[23][24] which fell, respectively, to the
Neo-Assyrian Empire (c. 720 BCE) and Neo-Babylonian Empire (586 BCE).[25][26] Later rulers included the Achaemenid Empire,     
Alexander the Great, the Seleucid Empire, the Hasmonean dynasty, and, from 63 BCE, the Roman Republic and later Roman Empire.<img class ="map" src = "Images/israel_map.png">
From the 5th century CE, it was part of the Byzantine Empire, up until the 7th century Rashidun Caliphate's conquest of the Levant.
With the First Crusade of 1096–1099, Crusader states were established. Muslim rule was then restored in 1291 by the Mamluk
Sultanate, which later ceded the territory to the Ottoman Empire.

During the 19th century, the Zionist movement began promoting the creation of a Jewish homeland in Ottoman Syria. Following World
War I, Britain was granted control of the region by League of Nations mandate, in what became known as Mandatory Palestine. After
World War II, the newly formed United Nations adopted the Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947, recommending the creation of
independent Arab and Jewish states, and an internationalized Jerusalem.[29] Following a civil war within Mandatory Palestine
between Yishuv and Palestinian Arab forces, Israel declared independence at the termination of the British Mandate. A day later,
several surrounding Arab countries intervened, leading to the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, which concluded with the 1949 Armistice
Agreements that saw Israel in control of most of the former mandate territory, while the West Bank and Gaza were held by Jordan and
Egypt respectively. Over 700,000 Palestinian Arabs, about half of the pre-war Arab population, were expelled from or fled the 
territory Israel would come to control. During and immediately after the war, around 260,000 Jews emigrated or fled from the Arab
world to Israel.

Israel has since fought wars with several Arab countries,[31] and since the 1967 Six-Day War has occupied the Golan Heights and
the Palestinian territories of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, though whether Gaza remains occupied
following the Israeli disengagement is disputed. Israel has effectively annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, though these
actions have been rejected as illegal by the international community, and established settlements within the occupied territories, 
which are also considered illegal under international law. While Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and has 
normalized relations with a number of other Arab countries, it remains formally at war with Syria and with Lebanon, and efforts to 
resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have thus far stalled.

In its Basic Laws, Israel defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state, and as the nation-state of the Jewish people. 
The country has a parliamentary system, proportional representation, and universal suffrage. 
The prime minister serves as head of government and the Knesset is the unicameral legislature. 
Israel is a developed country and an OECD member,[34] with a population of over 9 million people as of 2021. 
It has the world's 29th-largest economy by nominal GDP,[17] and ranks nineteenth in the Human Development Index.
